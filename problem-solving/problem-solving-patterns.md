**What is an algorithm**
- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

**Problem Solving Strategies**
- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/simplify
- Look back and refactor


**Understand the Problem**
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determiend from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough info to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

**Explore concrete examples**
- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explpre examples with invalid inputs

**Break it down**
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

**Solve/Simplify**
- *Simplify*
  - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
  - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
  - Write a simplified solution
  - Then incorporate that difficulty back in

**Look back and refactor**
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
