**Problem Solving Patterns**

**Some patterns**
- Frequency counter
- Multiple pointers
- sliding window
- divide and conquer
- dynamic programming
- greedy algorithms
- backtracking
- many more!

**Frequency Counters**
- This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings

**Mulitple Pointers**
- Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
