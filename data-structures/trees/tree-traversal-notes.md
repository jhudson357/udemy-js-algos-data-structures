**Tree Traversal**

**Two Ways**
1. Breadth-first Search (BFS)
   1. going across (left to right thru tree)
2. Depth-first Search (DFS) - traversing down the tree rather than horizontally like BFS
   1. InOrder
   2. PreOrder
   3. PostOrder

*Breadth-first Search (BFS)*
**Looking at every sibling node before moving down to the children nodes
- Create a queue (this can be an array) and a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Place the root node in the queue
- Loop as long as there is anything in the queue
  - Dequeue a node from the queue and push the value of the node into the variable that stores the nodes
  - If there is a left property on the node dequeued - add it to the queue
  - If there is a right property on the node dequeued - add it to the queue
- Return the variable that stores the values

*Depth-first Search (DFS)*
**PreOrder**
- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
- Invoke the helper function with the current variable

**PostOrder**
- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - Invoke the helper function with the current variable
- Return the array of values

**InOrder**
- Create a variable to store the values of nodes visited
- Store the root of the BST in a variable called current
- Write a helper function which accepts a node
  - If the node has a left property, call the helper function with the left property on the node
  - Push the value of the node to the variable that stores the values
  - If the node has a right property, call the helper function with the right property on the node
- Invoke the helper function with the current variable
- Return the array of values
