**Graph Traversal**
- Visiting/Updating/Checking each vertex in a graph

**Graph traversal uses**
- Peer to peer networking
- Web crawlers
- Finding 'closest' matches/recommendations
- Shortest path problems
  - GPS navigation
  - Solviing mazes
  - AI (shortest path to win the game)


**PSEUDOCODE**
*Depth First Traversal*
** Explore as far as possible down one branch before 'backtracking'
RECURSIVE
- The function should accept a starting node
- Create a list to store the end result, to be returned at the very end
- Create an object to store visited vertices
- Create a helper function which accepts a vertex
  - The helper function should return early if the vertex is empty
  - The helper function should place the vertex it accepts into the visited object and push that vertex into the result array.
  - Loop over all of the values in the adjacencyList for that vertex
  - If any of those values have not been visited, recursively invoke the helper function with that vertex
- Invoke the helper function with the starting vertex

ITERATIVE
- The function should accept a starting node
- Create a stack to help use keep track of vertices (use a list/array)
- Create a list to store the end result, to be returned at the very end
- Create an object to store visited vertices
- Add the starting vertex to the stack, and mark it visited
- While the stack has something in it:
  - Pop the next vertex from the stack
  - If that vertex hasn't been visited yet:
    - â€‹Mark it as visited
    - Add it to the result list
    - Push all of its neighbors into the stack
- Return the result array
