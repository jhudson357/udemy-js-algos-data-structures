**DATA STRUCTURES**

- Data structures are collecitons of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
  - e.g. Array - holds values, have built in methods, store the order of each value

**ES2015 Class Syntax Overview**
*What is a class?*
- A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods

*Class Syntax*
- Classes should start with a capital letter (camel case)
- The method to create new objects *must* be called constructor - used to instantiate new instances of the class
- The class keyowrds creates a constant, so you cannot redefine it 
- To create a new instance (instantiate objects from a class) --> use the *'new'* keyword

**Instance Methods**
- Methods that provide functionality to a single instance of a class (an individual student)

**Class Methods**
- Use the *'static'* keyword
- Define methods/functionality that is pertinent to classes rather than the individual instances
- Not that common - instance methods are more common
- Often used to create utility funcitons for an application

**'this' keyword**
- Inside all of our *instance* methods and *constructor*, the keyowrd *'this'* refers to the object created from that class (also known as an *instance*)
