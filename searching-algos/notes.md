**Searching Algorithms**

**How do we search?**
- Given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want. (this method is good for unsorted arrays - this is called *LINEAR SEARCH*)

**JavaScript has search!**
- There are many different search methods on arrays in JS
  - indexOf
  - includes
  - find
  - findIndex
