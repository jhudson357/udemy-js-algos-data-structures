**RECURSION**
- A process (a function in our case) that calls itself

**How recursive functions work**
- Inovke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case
- Base case
  - the condition when the recursion ends
  - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT TO UNDERSTAND

**Two essential parts of a recursive function**
- base case
- different input

**Where things go wrong**
- No base case
- Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing
